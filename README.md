# Legends of Machete

A simple two-dimensional game in retro style, for which no game engine, 
but only Java standard libraries are used.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic player movement
- [ ] Moving map in the background
- [ ] NPCs 
- [ ] Entertaining fight system
- [ ] Much more...

## Resources

We use [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) for designing pixelart. This project 
should be compatible with every IDE (I hope).

More Information coming soon...
